## Top 10 rating movies under the influence of Covid-19

[Top10 rating movie information in 2019 and 2020](2019-2020Top10ratingdata.html){target="_blank"}


Explanation of the graph:

Here, we make an interactive graphic of D3 about the film industry by imitating the Problem in Problem Set5. 
There are three main conclusions: 

1. From the perspective of top10rating films in the past two years, the overall range of ratings has increased and the highest score has increased, but the box office of Top10rating films has decreased. This may be due to different statistics from year to year, and 2020, the first year after the pandemic, will also see changes in audience ratings and a general decline in box office.

2. Although the highest-scoring films in both years were foreign films, 2019 was dominated by 《Parasite》, while 2020 was dominated by an Indian film. This is probably due to the shutdown of the film industry around the world. 

3. The total number of votes cast in 2020 dropped significantly. This has also led to the rise of Indian films outside Europe and America.
